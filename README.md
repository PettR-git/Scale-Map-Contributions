# Scale-Map-Contributions
Some of the classes contributing to Scale_Map branch of "eddy", a part of exjob. The functionality involves scaling a map in various ways (increasing/decreasing the number of tiles), and comparing the content of the original map and the ideas behind it with an AI-scaled map. Essentially, an AI-scaled map is utilizing data from original map and applies the AI of eddy to mimic certain datapoints (symmetry, number of patterns, similarity, etc..) to represent it as an alternatively scaled version.
